# ðŸŽ¯ LoopMasterAssignment

Welcome to the **Loop Mastery** assignment! This exercise is designed to help you practice the use of different **looping constructs** in Java including:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

You will write a Java program that performs the following tasks:

1. **Print a right-angled triangle** of asterisks using a `for` loop.
2. **Calculate the factorial** of the input number using a `while` loop.
3. **Print a countdown** from the input number to 1 using a `do-while` loop.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input

An integer `n` entered by the user via standard input.

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output

Given an input `n = 4`, your program should produce the following output:

```
*
**
***
****
Factorial: 24
Countdown: 4 3 2 1
```

---

## ðŸ“„ File to Edit

You must write your code in the file:

```
LoopMaster.java
```

---

## âœ… Autograding Tests

Your submission will be automatically graded against the following criteria:

1. Compilation of `LoopMaster.java`
2. Correct output for:
   - Triangle pattern using `for` loop
   - Factorial using `while` loop
   - Countdown using `do-while` loop

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

You can test your code locally using the terminal:

```bash
javac LoopMaster.java
echo 4 | java LoopMaster
```

Expected Output:

```
*
**
***
****
Factorial: 24
Countdown: 4 3 2 1
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Submission Guidelines

- Do **not** rename the `LoopMaster.java` file.
- Push your changes to GitHub after editing.
- Make sure your code compiles and passes all tests.

Good luck, and happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
